# MultiMC5 with offline
This project is archived now. If you want compile project from sources you need switch to [stable](https://github.com/Ponywka/MultiMC5-with-offline/tree/stable) or [develop](https://github.com/Ponywka/MultiMC5-with-offline/tree/develop) branch.
For alternative I recommend use [AfoninZ/MultiMC5-Cracked](https://github.com/AfoninZ/MultiMC5-Cracked) fork of original MultiMC. This developer can support repository better that me.

Thanks for use this fork before!
